				We all have a purpose. And we believe that each person on earth was created with specific design and intention by our perfect Maker. We've been amazed by and blessed to discover artists throughout California, across the nation, and all over the world that have the same mission as ourselves: <b>to use our God-given gifts of dance, music, song, and the arts to glorify our ultimate Creator.</b>

				We want to display the impact God has already done through the arts to remind each other of the reason why we perform in the first place, to encourage and spur one another on to see how we and others are all making an impact for His Kingdom, and to display to others that God touches and softens people's hearts in such a way that could only be described as an amazing encounter with love.
