				<h1>ABOUT PROJECT LIGHT</h1>
				<h2>EACH OF US HAS A PURPOSE.</h2> 
				<p>Project Light is founded on the belief every person was created with specific design and intention, combined with a discovery of artists all throughout California, across the nation, and all over the world that have the same mission as ourselves: <b>to use our God-given gifts of dance, music, song, and the arts to glorify Him.</b></p>

				<h2>WHAT DOES "PROJECT LIGHT" MEAN?</h2>
				 <ol align="left">
				 	<li><b>To spread the impact</b> God has already done and continues to do through the arts to remind each other of why we perform in the first place,</li><br>
				 	<li> <b>To encourage and spur</b> one another on to witness how we and others are all making an impact for His Kingdom,</li><br>
				 	<li> <b>To testify to others</b> that God touches and softens people's hearts in such a way that could only be described as an amazing encounter with Love.</li>

				<h2>MORE THAN A SHOWCASE</h2> 
				<ul align="left">
					<small><li>To <b>unify</b> Christian performers in mutual support upon seeing a bigger picture of what God is doing within performance culture to spread his love and strengthen his Kingdom.</li>

					<li>To <b>reawaken</b> the reason behind why we dance, play music, or use any of our abilities for him, and to reignite our hearts to work towards more, together.</li>

					<li>To <b>encourage</b> Christian performers to continue drawing inspiration from Christ, and to remind the arts community that stewarding our gifts, time, and resources to help the world become better is a greater gift than winning titles or accolades.</li>

					<li>To <b>showcase</b> the talents God has placed in performers, and to share the impact Jesus has made within all of us through these gifts.</li>

					<li>To <b>reveal</b> a glimpse of God's Kingdom to audiences by inspiring, emboldening, and providing community to other Christian artists who can mobilize in their own cities and use their talents for him.</li>

					<li>To <b>steward</b> all proceeds to make a broader impact, donating to an organization that all performers together agree on.</li>

					<li>To <b>change</b> the world we live in using the crafts God has granted us, so that we may fulfill and demonstrate the greater Purpose of why we dance, and why we love.</li></small>

				<h2>THE INSPIRATION</h2> 
				Our current founding team is composed of members and directors of sister dance ministry teams Agape from UC Davis and Abba Modern from UC Berkeley who created this event inspired by a vision of worshipful unity amongst Christian artists. 
				<p>We can't wait to see what new friendships, partnerships, and transformations that God will form through Project Light!</p>
