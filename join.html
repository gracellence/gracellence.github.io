				<h2>PERFORM</h2> 
				We are still looking for artists to be in our lineup!

				<p>As a performer, you'll get to participate in a special fellowship time before the showcase during which all the performers will get to share and learn about how God has been moving in each other's work, complimentary food, and the priceless experience of being part of a unique showcase in unity with other Christian artists!</p>

				<b>Apply to perform <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WiQDpr5eAVdLwLyujyXYhTKIXMj1vcB-7bBqOGayrso/viewform?c=0&w=1">here</a>.</b>

				<h2>VOLUNTEER</h2> 
				We're always open to more helping hands in any aspect of operations: media, finance, marketing, communications, fundraising, sponsorships, logistics, admin, event planning, etc.

				<p>As part of the official Project Light coordinating team, you'll get an extraordinary experience of being a part of making this event happen. You'll get to learn and strengthen valuable skills to add to your own professional development and yes, your resume.</p>

				<p>Not to mention, you'll also get to befriend and work with an awesome team of Christ-honoring, logistics-loving people who share a vision and passion of bringing this event to life and sharing God's truth and love with the world!</p>

				<b>Fill out the volunteer survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tR2ApDz7Qa5nf4zPKJpgWDXB6-QhAq3fXN7Qw133IoQ/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form">here</a>.</b>

				<h2>DONATE</h2> 
				Soon, we will be launching a big Indiegogo campaign to make this event possible!

				<p>100% of proceeds go into making this showcase happen, including costs for: <br>
					the venue rental, crew, and insurance ($12,850); ticketing services ($450), publicity materials and hospitality materials for performers ($800), honorariums and plane tickets for featured artists ($6,000), and more. Our estimated total cost is <b>$20,100.</b><br>
				This campaign is aiming for only half of that, as we are also planning to reach out to local churches and communities for offline sponsorships.</p>

				<p>In return, you get all the goodies and benefits described in the perk(s) you select, as well as the invaluable experience of witnessing a God-glorifying performing arts showcase LIVE!</p>

				<b>Link to campaign will be announced December 7, 2015.</b>
