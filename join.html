				<p>As a performer, you'll get to participate in a special fellowship time before the showcase during which all the performers will get to share and learn about how God has been moving in each other's work, complimentary food, and the priceless experience of being part of a unique showcase in unity with other Christian artists!</p>

				<b>Apply to perform <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WiQDpr5eAVdLwLyujyXYhTKIXMj1vcB-7bBqOGayrso/viewform?c=0&w=1">here</a>.</b>

				<h2>DONATE</h2> 
				Although our <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/at/projectlight">Indiegogo campaign</a> has ended, we are still looking for funding and financial contributions to pay for the costs of this event.

				<p>100% of funds go into making this showcase happen, including costs for: <br>
					the venue rental, crew, and insurance ($12,850); ticketing services ($450), publicity materials and hospitality materials for performers ($800), honorariums and plane tickets for featured artists ($6,000), and more. Our estimated total cost is <b>$20,100.</b><br>
				
				<p>In addition, all profits will be donated to <a href="http://www.newdayforchildren.com">New Day for Children</a>, a faith-based non-profit organization that seeks to recover children caught in the despair of child sex trafficking and to restore their stolen childhoods.</p>
